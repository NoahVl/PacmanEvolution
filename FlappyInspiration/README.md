# NEAT_FlappyBird


# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday, Feb 15 at 12 PM PST 

Create your own NEAT bot that plays a game of your choice. It could be a simulated environment really. Bonus points for creativity and good documentation. Post your github links in the comment section of the video. Good luck!

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/hVv68aHYSs4) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. 

Implementation of the NEAT algorithm for learning an agent to play Flappy Bird.

The game was designed using the pygame library while NEAT was implemented using the Python-NEAT package.

flappyBird2.py : Basic python game. Allows user to play Flappy Bird

flappyBird3.py : Implements NEAT algorithm to train game playing bot ( Neural Network )

testBird.py : Runs 10 runs of a given trained model to evaluate its performance
